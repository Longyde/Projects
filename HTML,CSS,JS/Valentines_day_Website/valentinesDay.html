        </p>
        <p>
            The home – the place where you end up your day, 
            the family – where you find your people to love, 
            ME – it’s only me who accepts and cares for you in any circumstance. 
            My love towards you is unconditional.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like all the ways that we hang out together, even when were mad. 
            And I like the things that are not appropriate for a greeting card.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will hold on you forever because I have never known someone more special than you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your smile is as sweet as nectar. Your kiss as soft as silk. Your gaze as warm and peaceful as a sunrise.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t just love you. I love that I get to have you as my Valentine. Happy Valentine’s Day!
        </p>
        <p>
            The day becomes a happy valentine day only because of you my dear; yes you are my sweet VALENTINE!
