       			The magic that you will notice for your first visit will make you understand the reference. <b>Paw-gwarts</b> is a <b><u>35 day</u></b> investment in your pal. They will come stay with us and receive a degree of training that only we can provide by teaching them at all hours of each day. 
       		</p>
       		<p>
       			<b>Paw-gwarts</b> will teach them obedience commands, and these commands are tailored to you. If you want <i id="red">Elmo</i> to mean rollover, then that is how we will teach it. Every other week we will ask to set a time to meet in house and occasionally in the store to work on training for your pal. While at <b>Educanine</b>, your pal will be safe and well kept. They will become kid friendly, other animal friendly, and well socialized as well as reduced anxiety. On the trainings in store, we teach them to ignore distractions and to focus on you and you only. The store could be in fire and as long as you are okay standing with them during the panic, they will be with you.
