        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Educanine has been in business for over five years, but the knowledge we contain is over half a century old combined.</p> 
        <p>We have been in the animal industries as vet technicians, animal dieticians, animal trainers, breeders of notable breeds such as the karelian bear dog, and so much more exposure. We have been training dogs for decades, constantly learning as new methods and means arise. </p>
        <h2>How we teach?</h2>
        <p>We understand that the training is not just results based, its animal based. We don't just repetitively ask for the same command and accept the results, rather we practice positive and negative reinforcement as well as positive and negative punishment.</p>

          <figcaption>The positive and negative reinforcement/positive and negative punishment model. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> This is the base to many behavioral correcting practices and does not involve any worry about animal cruelty or other worrisome actions. We hold your pal to a standard and hold ourselves to an even higher standard for providing care, training, and customer service. We understand that some behaivors are animal specific and breed specific and we will train accordingly. We will have your pal feeling healthy, acting amazing, and have you happy as can be. We “Nose” your pal is important to you, so we offer all we can to make sure the relationship stays. </p>
