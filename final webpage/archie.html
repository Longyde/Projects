        <h2>Who is Archie?</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Archie</b> is the resident Chihuahua who is great with and for new puppies, big dogs, and especially dogs with a high prey drive such as wolf mixes, pit bulls, and more aggressive breeds. 
        </p>
          <p>
            Being a small breed dog, <b>Archie</b> is known for his dinner rolls (the act of rolling over for really anyone) on his back. He is great at being the prey to those very aggressive dogs, but he is a kind soul that trains those aggressors to love small animals. He also teaches big dogs to play gently with smaller dogs. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            Don't mistake <b>Archie's</b> small size as a weakness. <b>Archie</b> is one of the more active Chihuahua's, constantly performing bite work and the first to find dropped food. Around the Educanine facility, <b>Archie</b> is known as the "Gapper" because he slides into any gap he possibly can.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Archie</b> is also great to teach dogs that no matter what another dog is doing, they should be focused on what they were instructed to do. The little ones always get away with it.
