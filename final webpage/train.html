        <h3>In-home consultation</h3>

        <p>
          This is a <b><u>120 minute (2 hour)</u></b> consultation that will help us determine the best method to get your pal the appropriate leveof training needed to get them Educated. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In-home is recommended as we see your pal in their natural habitat, around the people they will see constantly. We don't just train your pal, we get them accustomed to the family so we involve as little of us and as much as you as possible on this first visit.
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li>120 minute ~ in-home or mutual location visit.</li>
            <li>Observation of your pal in their natural element with the people they'll be around the most.</li>
            <li>Small scale exercises to asses trainability.</li>
            <li>Recommendations and estimates on cost.</li>

        <a id="tt"><h3 >Puppy temperment testing</h3></a>
        <p>
          We will escort you to the new family members litter and perform various test with the prospective puppy to give you an analysis of what your future pal may be like.

        <p> 
          Obedience has fallen off or you are not ready for PAW-gwarts, we can still do in-home training or at a local store. These sessions are personalized to your pal, so they are getting effective training each time. We will ensure that your pal is getting the Education they need and deserve. This is for all dogs aged 6 Months and up.

        <a id="epp"><h3 >Early Puppy prep</h3></a>
        <p>
          This series of training involves getting your new pal prepared for training. It is NOT recommended to start training until roughly <b>6 months</b> so we utilize the time before to get them excited for some Educanine. We get them potty trained and socialized by bringing some of our resident experts (see <a href="archie.html">Archie</a> and <a href="archie.html">Sabre</a>) to come and play. Puppy prep will have your puppy being adorable and looking like they were born to be a star.

          This camp is all-inclusive! Educanine specializes in problem prevention, early training, and moderate to severe behavior adjusments (aka your dog always tries to eat the cat or tear up furniture). We tackle aggression and fear based issues and use these as opportunities to teach both dog and owner better ways to communicate. We do basic and advanced obedience, CGC(Canine Good Citizen) preparation, behavior modification, and so much more. <a href="boot.html">PAW-warts</a> awaits you...

        <p> 
          Schutzhund is about obedience, personal protection, and tracking. This is for the more advanced clients that are looking to put their pals to the test. Schutzhund is fun, but can be very challenging on you and you pal. We will prep your friend with the basic skills necessary to be able to partake in Schutzhund reated activities, even if for fun. This is <b>NOT</b> made for all dogs, but for those pals that like to sniff around, this is your training. We'll establish the basics of personal protection, obedience, and tracking as possible. Please understand that results will vary as Schutzhund is not for everyone, but we'll treat everyone with a personalized plan.
