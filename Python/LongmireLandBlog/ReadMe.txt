This is my Django Blog!


I enjoy the Python language so I dabbled with Django, a very popular framework, and created this blog.
I wanted to challenge myself and create something fun to hold many different types of projects in one spot! I plan to add a video player page, a game page, and much more.
This is deployable, but I want to expand the content.

Built  with Django, using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


The Project is a blog, with a small products section, dynamic text within the About Page that continously scrolls. The databases and the real=world functionality are amazing.

Setp 1) You can view the homepage, about, products, and many other pages, however a non-user cannot post!
